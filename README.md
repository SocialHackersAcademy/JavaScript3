# Module #4 - JavaScript 3: Object-Oriented Programming and working with APIs (Frontend)

![JavaScript3](./assets/javascript3.png)

Welcome to JavaScript3! Congratulations on making it this far. You're well on your way to the top!

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs!

On top of that you'll also learn how to think differently about how you write your programs. Like in any field, once you've mastered a particular way of doing things you start thinking about how it could be done differently. In programming we call these `paradigms` and in this module you'll learn one such paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming!

## Learning goals

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Learn what an API is
- Catch up on the history of JavaScript
- Understand how to write more readable asynchronous JavaScript
- Connect with different public APIs
- Build a Single Page Application (SPA)
- Work with pre-existing code
- Learn about Object-Oriented Programming

## How to use this repository

This repository consists of 3 essential parts:

1. `Reading materials`: this document contains all the required theory you need to know _**while**_ you're coding. It's meant as both study material and as a reference to understand what you're doing.
2. `Homework`: this document contains the instructions for each week's homework.
3. `Lesson Plans`: this part is meant for teachers as a reference. However, as a student don't be shy to take a look at it as well!

After your first class you should start off with checking the `reading materials` for that week. At the beginning that would be the [Week 1 Reading](/Week1/README.md). Study all the concepts and try to get the gist of everything. After, you can get started with the `homework` for that week.

If you have any questions or if something is not entirely clear ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯, please ask/comment on Slack!

## Before you start

In the following weeks we will be using a `styleguide` to help you write _"clean code"_. What is a styleguide? Simply put, it's a set of design standards put in one collection. Companies create and use them to define their public identity (their "brand"). Watch the following to get a better idea:

- [Creating Your Company's Style Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv_wrrY70E0)

A styleguide is made by designers. In the case of website design, this styleguide is then handed over to developers to use when styling the frontend.

The styleguide we'll be using is the one from Airbnb:

- [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

While you do not need to read this guide in detail, it is recommended that you look at sections 1-8, 12-13, 15-21 and 23.

The required packages you need to install in order to write code according to the styleguide are the following:

```json
"eslint"
"eslint-config-airbnb-base"
"eslint-config-prettier"
"eslint-plugin-import"
"eslint-plugin-prettier"
"prettier"
```

They are already in this repository's `package.json` so all you have to do now to prepare is to execute the following command in your command line:

```md
npm install
```

With this out of the way we can get started!
